To get the current date, you can just add:

|eval timenow=now()

This gets epoch time into the field timenow. If you want to format it, you can use strftime:

|eval nowstring=strftime(now(), "%Y-%m-%d")

If you want to convert your date to an epoch time:

|eval epochdate=strptime(yourdate, "%Y-%m-%d")

You can also use relative_time to find the epoch value of 30 days ago:

|eval epoch30days_ago=relative_time(now(), "-30d@d" )

This could be used to do a direct comparison with the strptime value from above.

Finally, you can do the strptime and set it to _time. This would allow you to set the time range directly:

|eval _time=strptime(yourdate, "%Y-%m-%d") |search latest=-30d
